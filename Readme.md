## Interlinking Analyser

The idea of this tool was taken from [this post](https://www.danielherediamejias.com/seo-internal-linking-analysis-with-python-and-networkx/)

To use it you have to run this two commands:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install matplotlib
    streamlit run app.py
